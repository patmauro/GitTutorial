<h1>Pizza Rustica</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 package yeast</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil of some kind</li>
<li>1 lb ricotta</li>
<li>1/2 pound shredded mozzarella</li>
<li>1/2 pound genoa salami</li>
<li>1/2 pound of prosciutto</li>
<li>1/2 pound hot soppressata</li>
<em>Note: All the meats should be cut 1/4 inch thick and then cut into 1/4 inch dice. Have the deli guy cut the slices 1/4 inch thick.</em>
<li>1/4 cup grated pecorino cheese</li>
<li>3-5 eggs</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>I. Drain the Ricotta</h2>
<p>Drain the ricotta through a cheesecloth or similar thing overnight or at least for several hours.</p>

<h2>II. Dough</h2>
<p>First the dough. This is very simple and easy to work with dough.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 package yeast (1/4 oz)</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil of some kind</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix one cup flour with sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Heat milk and oil until warm but not hot. Just warm until you can feel it with your finger. Add this to the flour mixture. Mix well. If you have an electric mixer, this is better. Add the rest of the flour. You can add up to another 1/2 cup of flour if the dough is too sticky. Knead for ten minutes. Put it in an oiled bowl and cover. Let it rise twice - probably about an hour and a half total.</p>

<h2>III. For the filling:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 lb ricotta</li>
<li>1/2 pound shredded mozzarella</li>
<li>1/2 pound genoa salami</li>
<li>1/2 pound of prosciutto</li>
<li>1/2 pound hot soppressata</li> 
<em>(All the meats should be cut 1/4 inch thick and then cut into 1/4 inch dice. Have the deli guy cut the slices 1/4 inch thick.)</em>
<li>1/4 cup grated pecorino cheese</li>
<li>3-5 eggs</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Push the drained ricotta through a mesh strainer to get some air in it. Combine with the rest of the ingredients above and four of the eggs.</p>

<p>Oil a cast iron pan or similar oven safe baking thing with high sides. Divide the dough in two. Roll out the first half (maybe a bit more than half) and place it in the pan and up and over the sides. Add the filling. Roll out the other half and place it on top. Crimp the top and bottom edges together by folding the bottom overhanging part up and over the top piece and crimp together to form a nice edge crust. Cut four slits in the top piece to let the steam escape. Beat the last egg and brush it all over the top for a glaze. Bake at 350-375  degrees for about an hour. If you start at 375 watch to make sure the crust isn't baking too fast. If it is, turn it down to 350.</p>

<p>This is usually served on Easter, but you can make it whenever you want.</p>
