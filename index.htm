<h1>What a Git Repo!</h1>
<p>Like the readme says, welcome to my Git Tutorial repo. I use this repo essentially as a test sandbox if there are certain Git concepts I want to experiment with before committing to any actual project.</p>
<p>This is fully redesigned from the old tutorial I followed with more generic stuff I wrote. That way I feel more comfortable experimenting with it. There is also image of a coffee grinder above. I don't know why, it just looks cool.</p>
